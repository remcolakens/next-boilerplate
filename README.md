## Usage

For new projects you should be using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as your package manager.
It has some advantages over yarn and npm but it's main purpose is to be a fast and disk space efficient.

If you are new to pnpm you need to [install it on your local machine](https://pnpm.io/installation), afterwards you can follow the instructions below.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Install playwright for end-to-end tests
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps

# Start local webserver at port 3000
pnpm dev

# Run linters
pnpm lint

# Run unit tests
pnpm test

# Run end-to-end tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Build app for production (gets output in the 'dist' directory)
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start
```
